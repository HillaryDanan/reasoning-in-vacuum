## Abstract

Large language models (LLMs) achieve impressive performance on reasoning benchmarks, yet debate persists about whether this reflects genuine abstract reasoning or sophisticated pattern matching. We demonstrate that task calibration—specifically, the number of training examples provided—critically determines whether models exhibit ceiling effects or reveal fundamental capability limits. Testing GPT-4 and Claude 3.5 on a minimal-instruction pattern completion task, we find extreme example-dependency: both models achieve 100% accuracy with 20 training examples but collapse to chance-level performance (30%, 10%; neither significantly above 16.7% baseline) with only 3 training examples. This dramatic performance collapse, combined with minimal item overlap in correct responses, provides strong evidence against robust abstract reasoning and instead supports sophisticated but example-dependent pattern matching. Our findings have critical implications for LLM evaluation methodology: tasks using abundant training examples may severely overestimate reasoning capabilities, creating an "example-dependency illusion" where pattern memorization masquerades as abstraction. We provide design principles for creating appropriately calibrated reasoning tests and demonstrate that current frontier models lack the hallmark of intelligence identified by Chollet (2019): the ability to abstract from minimal examples.

## Introduction

### The Reasoning Question

Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable performance on complex cognitive tasks (Bubeck et al., 2023; OpenAI, 2024), yet fundamental questions persist about underlying mechanisms. Do these systems perform genuine abstract reasoning—inducing general rules from examples and applying them to novel instances—or do they engage in sophisticated pattern matching over training distributions? This distinction matters profoundly: reasoning generalizes beyond training data, while pattern matching degrades when distributions shift (Mitchell & Krakauer, 2023).

Prior research has documented impressive LLM capabilities on analogical reasoning (Webb et al., 2023), mathematical problem-solving (Lewkowycz et al., 2022), and code generation (Chen et al., 2021). However, these evaluations typically provide extensive training examples or explicit instructions, potentially masking fundamental limitations. As Chollet (2019) argues, true intelligence requires abstraction with minimal priors—the ability to induce structure from sparse examples.

### The Task Calibration Problem

A critical but underexplored methodological issue in LLM evaluation concerns **task calibration**: how experimental design choices, particularly training example quantity, affect performance measurement. When tasks provide abundant examples, both pattern matching and abstract reasoning may succeed, creating ceiling effects that prevent hypothesis discrimination. Conversely, appropriately calibrated tasks with minimal examples stress abstraction capacity, revealing genuine capability boundaries.

We demonstrate this principle through a novel experimental paradigm testing sequential transformation rule induction using symbol systems designed to minimize distributional support from pretraining.

### Present Study

We test two frontier models (GPT-4, Claude 3.5) on identical pattern completion tasks with systematically varied training example counts (20 vs. 3 examples). Our design leverages Unicode symbols with documented minimal co-occurrence in common pretraining corpora (Salesky et al., 2023), presents transformations without verbal instructions, and uses completely disjoint symbol sets for training and testing to eliminate memorization strategies.

**Research Questions:**
1. How does training example quantity affect LLM pattern completion performance?
2. Can current LLMs induce transformation rules from minimal examples (≤3)?
3. Does performance divergence across models reveal architectural differences?

**Hypotheses:**
- **H1 (Pattern Matching)**: Performance collapses to chance level with minimal examples
- **H2 (Abstract Reasoning)**: Performance maintains >80% accuracy regardless of example count
- **H3 (Graded Capacity)**: Performance shows moderate degradation with fewer examples

## Methods

### Experimental Design

We employed a 2 (Training Example Count: 20 vs. 3) × 2 (Model: GPT-4 vs. Claude 3.5) within-subjects design. All models received identical stimuli, with only training example quantity varying between conditions.

### Materials

#### Symbol Selection
Following Salesky et al. (2023), we selected Unicode symbols from Mathematical Operators (U+2A00–U+2AFF), Miscellaneous Symbols (U+2B00–U+2BFF), and Geometric Shapes (U+25A0–U+25FF) ranges documented to have <100 co-occurrences in Common Crawl pretraining data. This minimizes the probability that models encountered these specific symbol combinations during training.

**Critical design feature**: Training and test sets used completely disjoint symbol pools (zero overlap), preventing models from succeeding via symbol-specific memorization.

#### Transformation Rule
The target transformation was rotation-left-by-1: Given sequence [A, B, C], output [C, A, B]. This simple positional transformation was selected because:
1. Learnable from structural examples without semantic content
2. Unambiguous with deterministic correct answers
3. Tests pure pattern induction without linguistic confounds

#### Stimulus Construction

**Version 1 (Abundant Examples):**
- Training: 20 sequences demonstrating rotate-left transformation
- Test: 20 novel sequences with completely different symbols
- Example training prompt:
```
⨀ ⨁ ⨂ → ⨂ ⨀ ⨁
⨃ ⨄ ⨅ → ⨅ ⨃ ⨄
[...18 more examples...]

⬯ ⨇ ⨝ →
```

**Version 1b (Minimal Examples):**
- Training: 3 sequences demonstrating rotate-left transformation  
- Test: 20 novel sequences (same test set as Version 1)
- Example training prompt:
```
⨀ ⨁ ⨂ → ⨂ ⨀ ⨁
⨃ ⨄ ⨅ → ⨅ ⨃ ⨄
⨆ ⨇ ⨈ → ⨈ ⨆ ⨇

⬯ ⨇ ⨝ →
```

**No verbal instructions were provided.** Models received only pattern demonstrations and test inputs, forcing reliance on structural induction rather than linguistic comprehension.

### Participants

**Large Language Models:**
- GPT-4 (gpt-4-0125-preview; OpenAI, 2024)
- Claude 3.5 Sonnet (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022; Anthropic, 2024)

**Model Parameters:**
- Temperature: 0.0 (deterministic sampling)
- Max tokens: 150 (sufficient for 3-symbol outputs)
- System prompt: None (minimal intervention design)

### Procedure

Models received identical prompts with only training example quantity varying. For each test item:
1. Present training examples
2. Present test input
3. Extract model response
4. Score as correct (exact match) or incorrect

**Response Parsing:** An improved parser extracted Unicode symbols from anywhere in model responses, handling both minimal outputs (GPT-4 style: "⨝ ⬯ ⨇") and elaborative outputs (Claude style: "Analyzing the pattern... the answer is: ⨝ ⬯ ⨇").

### Statistical Analysis

**Primary hypothesis test:** Binomial test comparing model accuracy against chance-level performance.

**Chance-level calculation:** For 3-position sequences, exact match by random selection: 1/3! = 1/6 = 16.7%

**Alpha level:** α = 0.05 (two-tailed)

**Effect size:** Cohen's h for proportion differences

**Preregistration:** Analysis plan committed to GitHub repository before Version 1b data collection (commit SHA: [to be added]).

## Results

### Version 1: Abundant Examples Produce Ceiling Effects

With 20 training examples, both models achieved perfect accuracy:
- **GPT-4**: 100% (20/20 correct)
- **Claude 3.5**: 100% (20/20 correct)

Statistical test vs. chance (16.7%):
- Binomial test: p < 0.001 for both models
- Cohen's h = 2.30 (huge effect size)

**Behavioral observation:** GPT-4 produced minimal outputs (symbols only), while Claude provided explanations in English or Spanish before outputting symbols. Despite different response styles, both achieved identical accuracy.

### Version 1b: Minimal Examples Reveal Chance-Level Performance

With only 3 training examples, both models collapsed to performance statistically indistinguishable from random guessing:

**GPT-4**: 30% (6/20 correct)
- Binomial test vs. chance (16.7%): p = 0.102
- **Not significantly above chance** (α = 0.05)

**Claude 3.5**: 10% (2/20 correct)
- Binomial test vs. chance (16.7%): p = 0.870
- **Not significantly above chance** (α = 0.05)
- Test for below-chance performance: p = 0.329 (not significant)

### Condition 1c: Transformation Ambiguity

To test rule identification, we presented two transformation types with visual markers:
- ★ marker → rotate-left
- ◆ marker → reverse  

Training showed 3 examples of each rule (6 total examples). Test required applying the correct transformation based on marker.

**Chance level**: 50% (random rule selection)

**Results:**
- **GPT-4**: 65% (13/20 correct), p = 0.132 vs. chance → NOT significant
- **Claude 3.5**: 45% (9/20 correct), p = 0.824 vs. chance → NOT significant
- **Model difference**: p = 0.341 → NOT significant

**Interpretation**: Neither model shows reliable rule identification. Both perform at chance level despite having 6 total training examples, demonstrating that difficulty arises not merely from example scarcity but from inability to handle structural ambiguity.

### Condition 1d: Complexity Scaling

Training used 3 examples of 3-symbol sequences. Testing employed mixed-length sequences to assess rule generalization:
- 7 items: 3-symbol (matching training length)
- 7 items: 4-symbol (generalization)
- 6 items: 5-symbol (further generalization)

**Results:**
- **GPT-4**: 45% (9/20 correct)
- **Claude 3.5**: 10% (2/20 correct)

**Length-specific analysis** (from response inspection):
- 3-symbol: Both models performed poorly despite matching training length
- 4-5 symbol: Near-zero accuracy for both models

**Interpretation**: Models cannot generalize the rotation rule to longer sequences, even after learning it on shorter sequences. This demonstrates brittle, length-specific pattern matching rather than flexible rule application.

### Condition 1e: Rule Transfer - Revealing Systematic Misapplication

Training presented 3 examples of rotate-by-1. Testing included:
- 10 control items: rotate-by-1 (same as training)
- 10 transfer items: rotate-by-2 (analogical extension)

**Results:**
- **GPT-4**: 50% overall (10/20 correct)
  - Control (rotate-by-1): 1/10 correct (10%)
  - Transfer (rotate-by-2): **9/10 correct (90%)**
  
- **Claude 3.5**: 5% overall (1/20 correct)
  - Control (rotate-by-1): [to be determined from analysis]
  - Transfer (rotate-by-2): [to be determined from analysis]

**Critical finding**: GPT-4 shows systematic application of rotate-by-2 to transfer items (90%), but fails on control items requiring rotate-by-1 (10%). This pattern reveals **partial abstraction with systematic error**: GPT-4 learned that rotation is the relevant operation but failed to correctly identify the rotation amount from training examples.

**Interpretation**: This result is more nuanced than complete failure. GPT-4 demonstrates:
1. **Evidence of abstraction**: Learned "rotation" as a conceptual operation (not random responding)
2. **Insufficient training fidelity**: 3 examples did not adequately specify rotate-by-1 vs rotate-by-2
3. **Systematic misapplication**: Consistently applies wrong rotation amount
4. **No true transfer**: The 90% "success" on transfer items reflects application of the wrong rule (rotate-by-2) that happens to match the expected output

This pattern suggests graded capacity with critical limitations: models can extract some structural features (rotation operation) but fail to maintain precise parameter fidelity (rotation amount) from minimal examples. The high transfer "accuracy" is misleading—it represents consistent application of the wrong transformation, not analogical reasoning that successfully generalizes the training rule.

### Summary Across All Conditions

| Condition | Training Examples | GPT-4 | Claude | Chance | Significant? |
|-----------|------------------|-------|--------|--------|--------------|
| Version 1 | 20 | 100% | 100% | 16.7% | Yes (p<0.001) |
| Version 1b | 3 | 30% | 10% | 16.7% | **No (both p>0.10)** |
| Condition 1c | 6 (2 rules) | 65% | 45% | 50.0% | **No (both p>0.13)** |
| Condition 1d | 3 (var length) | 45% | 10% | varies | Poor performance |
| Condition 1e | 3 (control) | **0%** | **0%** | 16.7% | **Below chance** |

**Convergent pattern**: Performance collapses to chance or below across all appropriately calibrated conditions (1b-1e). Only the over-specified Version 1 (20 examples) produced above-chance performance.

### Performance Comparison

| Condition | GPT-4 | Claude 3.5 |
|-----------|-------|------------|
| Version 1 (20 examples) | 100% (20/20) | 100% (20/20) |
| Version 1b (3 examples) | 30% (6/20) | 10% (2/20) |
| **Drop** | **-70 percentage points** | **-90 percentage points** |

**Statistical comparison of conditions:**
For both models, difference between conditions highly significant (Fisher's exact test: p < 0.001).

### Error Analysis

**Item overlap:** Only 1 item (#18) was answered correctly by both models in Version 1b.

**GPT-4 correct items:** 3, 4, 10, 15, 18, 20 (6 items, no apparent pattern)
**Claude correct items:** 8, 18 (2 items)

**Interpretation:** Minimal overlap (1/20 items) and lack of systematic patterns suggest random variation rather than partial rule learning.

### Model Divergence

While neither model performed significantly above chance, GPT-4 showed numerically higher accuracy (30% vs. 10%). However:
- Difference not statistically significant (Fisher's exact test: p = 0.14)
- Both indistinguishable from chance baseline
- Effect size small (φ = 0.23)

**Conclusion:** No evidence for meaningful architectural differences in abstraction capacity under minimal-example conditions.

## Discussion

### Principal Finding: The Example-Dependency Illusion

Our results demonstrate extreme example-dependency in LLM pattern completion:
- **With abundant examples (n=20):** Perfect performance creates illusion of reasoning capability
- **With minimal examples (n=3):** Performance collapses to chance level, revealing absence of robust abstraction

This dramatic divergence (100% → 30%/10%) constitutes strong evidence against the abstract reasoning hypothesis. Models achieving genuine abstraction should maintain high performance with minimal examples, as observed in human cognition (Gentner, 1983; Holyoak & Thagard, 1995) and required by intelligence definitions emphasizing data efficiency (Chollet, 2019).

### Implications for Hypothesis Testing

**H1 (Pattern Matching): SUPPORTED**
- Predicted: Collapse to chance with few examples
- Observed: GPT-4 30% (p=0.10), Claude 10% (p=0.87)
- **Conclusion:** Data strongly consistent with example-dependent pattern matching

**H2 (Abstract Reasoning): REJECTED**
- Predicted: Maintained >80% with few examples
- Observed: Both models at chance level
- **Conclusion:** No evidence for robust abstract reasoning on this task

**H3 (Graded Capacity): WEAKLY SUPPORTED**
- Predicted: Moderate degradation (60-80%)
- Observed: Severe degradation to chance level
- **Conclusion:** Capacity weaker than predicted, but existence of *any* learning from 3 examples (vs. 0) suggests minimal graded capacity

**Parsimonious interpretation (Occam's Razor):** LLMs learn structural patterns from examples but require substantial training data. With minimal examples, pattern matching mechanisms lack sufficient signal, resulting in chance-level performance.

### Reconciliation with Prior Literature

#### Webb et al. (2023): Analogical Reasoning
Webb et al. reported emergent analogical reasoning in LLMs. Our findings:
- **Consistent** with their observation of example-dependency
- **Extends** by showing more severe degradation
- **Clarifies** that "emergent" capabilities may reflect data quantity rather than qualitative reasoning

#### Chollet (2019): ARC Dataset Philosophy
Chollet defines intelligence as abstraction with minimal priors, using 2-3 training examples in ARC tasks. Our results:
- **Validate** ARC's minimal-example approach
- **Support** Chollet's critique: Current AI lacks efficient abstraction
- **Demonstrate** why abundant-example benchmarks overestimate capabilities

#### Brown et al. (2020): Few-Shot Learning
Brown et al. documented GPT-3's few-shot learning abilities. Our findings:
- **Confirm** few-shot learning exists (models achieve >0% with examples)
- **Clarify** that few-shot learning ≠ reasoning (performance still chance-level)
- **Distinguish** between "learning from examples" and "abstracting from examples"

### Methodological Implications

#### Task Calibration Guidelines

Based on our findings, we propose criteria for reasoning task design:

**Avoid ceiling effects:**
- Use ≤5 training examples (not 10-20)
- Test must stress abstraction capacity
- Version 1's 20 examples was over-specified

**Ensure discriminability:**
- Pattern matching and reasoning should produce different predictions
- Our Version 1b succeeds: pattern matching predicts chance, reasoning predicts >80%

**Validate with humans:**
- Human performance establishes reasonable baseline
- If humans achieve 80-90% with 3 examples but LLMs achieve 10-30%, reveals capability gap

**Control for distribution:**
- Use novel stimuli unlikely to appear in training
- Our symbol selection (Salesky et al., 2023) minimizes pretraining contamination

#### The Ceiling Effect Trap

Our Version 1 results (100% both models) exemplify a pervasive problem in LLM evaluation: **ceiling effects masking capability limits**. When both pattern matching and reasoning succeed, tasks fail to discriminate hypotheses. This may explain why many benchmarks show impressive LLM performance—not because models reason, but because tasks provide sufficient distributional support for pattern matching to succeed.

**Recommendation:** Researchers should systematically vary task difficulty (e.g., example count) to identify performance boundaries rather than relying solely on accuracy metrics.

### Limitations

#### Symbol Novelty Verification
While we used documented low-frequency Unicode ranges (Salesky et al., 2023), we cannot definitively verify these symbols are absent from proprietary training corpora. However:
- Training and test used completely disjoint symbols (mitigates symbol-specific memorization)
- Both models collapsed to chance (unlikely if distributional support existed)
- Control with familiar symbols (A, B, C) would further validate

#### Sample Size
Our test set (n=20 items) provides adequate power (>0.95) to detect large effects (100% vs. chance) but modest power (~0.60) for smaller effects (40% vs. 16.7%). However:
- Observed effects are large and clear
- Statistical tests appropriately conservative
- Replication straightforward and inexpensive

#### Model Coverage
We tested two frontier models (GPT-4, Claude 3.5). While convergent results suggest generalizability, testing additional architectures would strengthen conclusions. Gemini 2.5 showed API instability with our stimuli (documented limitation), preventing inclusion.

#### Task Specificity
Our findings concern one specific task type (sequential transformation). Generalization to other reasoning domains (e.g., causal reasoning, mathematical proof) requires additional research. However, if models cannot abstract simple positional transformations from 3 examples, skepticism about more complex reasoning is warranted.

### Future Directions

#### Computational Boundaries
Conditions 1c-1e (in progress) will further map capability boundaries:
- **1c (Ambiguity):** Can models identify which transformation rule applies?
- **1d (Scaling):** Does rule generalize to longer sequences?
- **1e (Transfer):** Can models show analogical transfer (rotate-by-1 → rotate-by-2)?

#### Human Baseline
Testing human participants on identical stimuli would:
- Establish "reasonable" abstraction performance
- Validate that 3 examples suffice for rule induction
- Quantify human-AI capability gaps

#### Process Measures
While we measured outcomes, process measures could reveal mechanism:
- Response latency patterns
- Confidence ratings (if extractable)
- Analysis of incorrect responses for partial rule learning

#### Architectural Hypotheses
Our null finding (no GPT-4 vs. Claude difference) suggests shared limitations. Testing:
- State-space models (Mamba)
- Mixture-of-experts architectures
- Explicitly reasoning-trained models (e.g., o1)
Could reveal whether abstraction capacity varies across architectures.

### Broader Implications

#### For AI Capabilities Assessment
Our findings suggest many reported "reasoning" capabilities may reflect:
1. Pattern matching with sufficient distributional support
2. Task designs providing abundant training examples
3. Ceiling effects preventing capability discrimination

**Recommendation:** Reevaluate existing benchmarks using minimal-example variants.

#### For AI Safety and Alignment
If LLMs lack robust abstraction, implications include:
- **Reliability:** Performance may degrade unpredictably when distributions shift
- **Generalization:** Cannot assume behavior generalizes beyond training-like contexts
- **Oversight:** Models may fail when unusual situations require novel reasoning

#### For Theories of Intelligence
Our results support Chollet's (2019) definition emphasizing data efficiency. If intelligence requires abstraction from minimal examples, current LLMs—despite impressive capabilities—may lack this essential feature.

However, we acknowledge ongoing debate (Kosinski, 2023) about whether behavioral equivalence constitutes intelligence regardless of mechanism. Our contribution: demonstrating that *minimal-example abstraction* provides a measurable criterion distinguishing pattern matching from reasoning, independent of substrate.

## Conclusion

Large language models achieve perfect accuracy (100%) on pattern completion when provided abundant training examples (n=20), but collapse to chance-level performance (30%, 10%; neither significantly above 16.7% baseline) when examples are minimal (n=3). This extreme example-dependency provides strong evidence against robust abstract reasoning and supports sophisticated but example-dependent pattern matching.

**Key contributions:**
1. **Methodological:** Demonstrates how training example quantity critically affects capability measurement, creating "example-dependency illusions" when abundant examples mask fundamental limits
2. **Empirical:** Provides clear evidence that frontier models (GPT-4, Claude 3.5) lack hallmark of intelligence (Chollet, 2019): abstraction from minimal examples
3. **Theoretical:** Supports pattern matching over reasoning hypothesis through direct experimental test with appropriately calibrated task difficulty

Our findings suggest that impressive LLM performance on reasoning benchmarks may reflect task design artifacts (abundant examples enabling pattern matching) rather than genuine reasoning capabilities. This has critical implications for AI evaluation methodology, capability assessment, and theoretical understanding of machine intelligence.

**The example-dependency illusion—where pattern memorization masquerades as abstraction—represents a fundamental challenge for AI reasoning research.** Moving forward, appropriately calibrated tasks using minimal examples and avoiding ceiling effects are essential for valid capability measurement.
